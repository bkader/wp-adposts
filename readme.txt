Allows you to create ads using codes or images and provides views and clicks counters, as well as locations management. You can even use the provided shortcode to insert ads into posts and pages.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create ads on your WordPress installation using codes or images. Views and clicks counter is provided as well as ads locations management.

**Ads Locations.** This is the main area of the plugin. You have to add at least one ads location in order to display ads. Because it is using a custom post type with a custom taxonomy, adding locations is like adding categories with extra fields, width and height, that will be used to determine ads dimensions.

**Ads Management.** It is like adding new WordPress posts with few exceptions. Ads can whether be images or codes (like Google Adsence). The better way to add images is to use Featured images and adding the ad link. If you use code, you can leave the ad link blank.
